  <p>
      {{ _("CropConnect originated from the LauzHack Against Covid19 competition in April 2020. We met and formed our initial team, including <b>Maxime Marchionno</b> 💻🍍 (EPFL), <b>Alix Buu-hoang</b> 🃏🍒 (EPFL), <b>Nicole Shi</b> 🐞🍑 (Carnegie Mellon University, EPFL exchange), and Simon Duchastel 🎮🍎 (University of Washington, EPFL exchange). We were motivated to launch this platform because of the seasonal worker shortage from the coronavirus and <b>Nicolas Peslerbe 💻🌶 </b> (Alumni-EPFL) have since joined and made instrumental contributions.") }}
